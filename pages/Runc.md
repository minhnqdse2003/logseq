# What
	- Runc is a lightweight universal container runtime that implements the Open Container Initiative (OCI) specification for spawning and running containers [1](https://www.docker.com/blog/runc/) [2](https://medium.com/@Mark.io/beginners-guide-to-runc-1b29cf281752).
	- Runc is a wrapper of  [[libcontainer]]. User can run a container with `runc` by using a config file with `json` extension but its complex and time-consuming.
	- Runc is a `low-level` when compare with `high-level` container runtimes like `Dockerd` & `Containerd`
		- Both of them are build on top of `runc`

		- [[Container runtime route]]
- # How
	- Reading an OCI configuration file that defines container process information like namespaces, capabilities, environment variables, etc [3](https://blog.quarkslab.com/digging-into-runtimes-runc.html).
	- Using this configuration along with a root filesystem directory to spawn a container process [3](https://blog.quarkslab.com/digging-into-runtimes-runc.html).
	- Providing isolation at different levels through Linux namespaces (PID, Net, IPC, MNT, UTS, User) [1](https://www.docker.com/blog/runc/) [3](https://blog.quarkslab.com/digging-into-runtimes-runc.html)
	- Docker installation has a single containerd process(docker-containerd) controlling the runc (docker-runc) instances associated with each other running container.
