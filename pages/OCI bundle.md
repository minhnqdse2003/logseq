- An OCI bundle is a standardize directory layout and file structure defined by [[OCI (Open Container Initiative)]] for launching container. It contains everything a container runtime needs to set up and run a container.
- #### Components of an OCI Bundle:
- **`config.json`**:
	- This is the main configuration file that describes how the container should be run.
	- It includes information such as:
		- Namespaces to create (e.g., PID, network, etc.).
		- Mount points and filesystem paths.
		- Resource constraints (e.g., CPU and memory limits).
		- Process details (e.g., entrypoint, arguments, environment variables).
- **Root Filesystem (`rootfs`)**:
	- A directory containing the root filesystem of the container.
	- This is the environment where the containerized application will run, including the libraries and binaries required by the application.
- # Why
	- Because OCI runtime specification and many variants of container engine, which mean they need a standardize rule and organization so that [[Runc]] can run it.
