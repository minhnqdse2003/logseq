- Think of a restaurant. Having multiple chefs (replicas) in the same kitchen (node) helps handle more orders and ensures that if one chef gets sick, the restaurant can still function. However, if the entire kitchen catches fire (node failure), the restaurant is out of business.
- Having multiple kitchens (nodes) in different locations, each with their own chefs (replicas), provides true resilience. Even if one kitchen is unavailable, the other kitchens can still serve customers.
- So, replicas provide redundancy and `scaling` ***within*** a **node**, while multiple nodes provide redundancy and scaling *across* your infrastructure. They work together to ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and efficient resource utilization. You need *both* for a truly robust and scalable application.
